# p2p-cortical
A model of cortical electronic prosthetic technologies

This code implements computational model or ‘virtual patient’, based on the neurophysiological architecture of visual cortex, which successfully predicts the perceptual experience of participants across a wide range of previously published human cortical stimulation studies describing the location, size, brightness and spatiotemporal shape of electrically induced percepts in humans. 

Simulations such as the above are likely to be critical for providing realistic estimates of prosthetic vision, thus providing regulatory bodies with guidance into what sort of visual tests are appropriate for evaluating prosthetic performance, and improving current and future technology.
